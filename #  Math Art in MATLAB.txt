#  Math Art in MATLAB

This project explores the beauty of mathematics through creative plotting using parametric equations in MATLAB. It combines geometry, trigonometry, and visual design to generate artistic patterns.

##  Overview

The script `math_art_plots.m` produces four mathematical art plots arranged in a 2Ã—2 grid:

| Plot Title       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Lissajous Curve** | A figure generated from sine waves with different frequencies and phase shifts |
| **Rose Curve**      | A classic polar equation converted to Cartesian form to create petal-like shapes |
| **Spirograph**      | A looping, circular pattern similar to those made with spirograph toys |
| **Galaxy Spiral**   | A mathematical spiral with a black background and colored styling to resemble a galaxy |

## How It Works

Each plot is generated using `subplot` and parametric equations. The plots demonstrate:

- Use of trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`)
- Polar-to-Cartesian conversion
- Styling with `LineWidth`, `Color`, and custom backgrounds
- Use of `axis equal` and `grid on` for clarity

The Galaxy Spiral subplot uses a black background and white text for a space-like aesthetic.
